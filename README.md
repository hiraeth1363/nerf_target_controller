using the circuit baord inside the target, you can take the input from the buttons and simulate key presses to play games. i played geometry dash with a nerf gun a minute ago

to make the arduino properly detect signals from the target's circuit board, you have to take the wires onto a breadboard, then to arduino. these connections are also connected to the arduino's ground through 10k resistors. the circuit board has a vdd pin for power (i did 5v)
